Sarah Lorraine,91,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,"I've been here many times, and have generally enjoyed it. The staff have been nice and I am constantly seeing them clean the gear. Whether you're playing solo or in with a group, they've got lots of game options. I have found the headsets to be uncomfortable, especially during the end of the session, despite trying to readjust. I have also found some of the games to be not the most beginner friendly. It took me 10 minutes (plus a staff member finally providing instructions) to figure out how to successfully cook a single pizza in a cooking game (turns out you flatten the pizza by banging your fist down multiple times, whereas I was trying to roll/search for a rolling pin). Grabbing objects was also finicky at points, as the grip didn't seem to be the best. I find some of the games are not the most intuitive and may benefit from brief tutorials on how to use.",0,
Tyler Hortie,2,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,"We hosted a party for 10 x 11/12 year-olds at Ctrl V Waterloo.

The only things that could have made our experience better would be having a sink/handwashing station in the party room and a longer time frame to use that room. 40 minutes is just not long enough. We felt rushed in the party room, but overall it was a fantastic experience!!! I highly recommend it!",0,

There's college kids that could put together a more professional video, and it also had one joke about having friends that was interesting when so much of your clientele are impressionable kids.

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I didn't realize a maladjusted headset would cause major headache after 30 minutes as the weight pressed down on the nose bridge restricting the airway. You would think that I should notice that right away but no, I got caught up in the game and by the time my head hurts, it was too late. I didn't ask but they gave me a refund for the remaining time I didn't play ($25 for 60 minutes and I think they refunded me half). The kids want to come back so we likely will be back sooner than later. It's more fun to play with a friend (split time) as the interaction enhances the fun. If a middle age woman like myself had fun at this place on first visit (despite the inconsequential headache), I think everyone else  can have fun too.",0,"Hello Lam, thank you so much for your detailed review. We're very sorry to hear that your headset was not adjusted properly for the first half of your playtime, but I'm happy to hear we were able to sort it out. Now you will be prepared and know what to expect for next time, so you can enjoy your hour-long session to the fullest!

Valerie Biega,1,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",7 years ago,"Fun time, but they mentioned the headsets get cleaned only once a week. They smelled horrible and irritated my skin so badly, my face was red and sore afterwards for hours.

We clean our headsets thoroughly in between every single session (every hour) and do another deep clean at the end of every day, much more frequently than once a week. If the headset is worn too tightly, sometimes the VR Cover from the headset presses against your face and leaves a slight imprint that we call ""VR Face,"" but this usually goes away after a few minutes - it should not have resulted in any irritation or soreness and I\'m sorry to hear that you experienced that. We only use approved Ctrl V cleaning agents on the headset to minimize the chance of damage to the hardware. During your next visit, if you have any specific concerns about the cleanliness of the headset, please do not hesitate to approach a staff for assistance. We hope to see you again soon!"

Ian Davis,1,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",7 years ago,"I have never used either a hand held controller or a joystick.  Spent the first 20 minutes stuck in pause mode which I could only exit by pressing a button that turned the entire system off.  Turning it back on put me back in pause mode.  A virtual ""exit pause mode"" while in pause mode would have been nice.  But I think I was expected to press some physical button on the controller I didn't even know existed.  I was completely ignored during this entire time by the sole attendant present.  He was across the room engrossed in watching other people play. He made not even a cursory check to see how I was doing, so was probably quite unaware that I was paying good money to watch a large blue clock count down.  One of the most frustrating experiences of my entire life.  Eventually I had to take off the equipment and physically go find this attendant to complain.  Your software needs an easily accessed online virtual user manual for first time users.  As I said to him ""if Pac Man had been this hard to use, it would never have caught on"".",4,"Hi Ian, thank you for taking the time to send us this feedback.  We really aim to make the experience as easy for beginners as possible, so on behalf of our team, I apologize for anything that happened to the contrary.' 'We\'ve reviewed the security footage from your session the other night, and we did notice that your group might have missed the explainer video which we play on our projector prior to every session. This explainer video is our version of a ""virtual user manual"" for our first-time users, as it provides a detailed demonstration of how to move in and out of content, and how to manage the pause menu.  If you have any suggestions as to how we could make this particular function more obvious in the video, we\'d really appreciate the input.' ""We have also reviewed our employee's actions during the start of your session.  It appears he visited your particular station five times in the first 10 minutes of your session to assist you.  He then came back an additional three times in the following 10 minutes.  We understand though, that when you are in VR, the sense of time is distorted, so it may have seemed like much longer between his visits."" ""If it's any consolation, the first VR experience for our customers always has the steepest learning curve.  We're confident that the issues you experienced won't be a problem during your next visit."" 'Thank you again for the valuable feedback - we look forward to hearing from you again soon! :)"
