Sade Euzebe,89,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a month ago,"Loads of fun. Great customer service. The game time flies by but it's an amazing experience. Since we were celebrating a birthday, we got a VR party after the game, which was a fun surprise.  We got 3 videos sent to us afterwards. The longest was 3 mins, I think. It's worth the cost. There are a lot of games so it's good for repeat visits. Heck, you could repeat the same game because it's hard to master in one visit. Highly recommended.",0,

Karen Chan,15,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,"Additionally, upon contacting the organizers to inquire why we were unable to choose all the advertised games, we were informed that we would have to schedule another session to play the remaining two games with duplicate games we already played. This response was quite baffling and only added to our disappointment. Spending $77 for just 30 minutes of play, during which we didn't get to experience all the games, doesn't seem like a worthwhile investment. We expected a comprehensive and fulfilling experience for the price we paid, and unfortunately, the reality fell short of our expectations.",0,

Crystle,148,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",4 months ago,"My group and I had an amazing time doing the Seekers of the Shard Dragonfire experience! It was so much fun choosing your powers and weapons, interacting with the enemies in the game and getting to choose your own path instead of the game just deciding for you. The visuals were stunning and they had some special effects too. Our host, Char, did an excellent job of making sure we understood how the experience works and took good care of us.

Madison St. Jacques,14,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",4 months ago,"Booked The Deadwood Valley gaming experience for my husband and his friends for his 35th birthday party. I reached out to Sandbox to confirm and book a space for lunch as the website describes areas to host birthdays and team building events. When we got there they had no idea what we were talking about and sadly our catered lunch sat on the dusty floor while we finished the game. We ended up having to take our food home. Overall the gaming experience was super cool and fun but we imagined something a bit more out of the facility like dedicated seating area's for the duration of the game, lockers and perhaps the opportunity to play more than one game, especially for the fee.",0,

kyle mclean,9,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",4 months ago,"Lots of fun and exceeded my expectations of a VR experience. Derek was very helpful and friendly, and made it a comfortable atmosphere for my group. You get a good cardio workout (quite sweaty at the end), I usually take around 2500 steps in the experience and have done seekers of the shard VR twice to take different paths. My only complaint is it is expensive and you are in game for around 45 minutes. At $60 a person it really adds up, but that is my only complaint. I would like to see the price come down to be more accessible for more frequent plays.",0,

sco jo,59,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,I think it was a great time because I got to be a black man even though I am a white man and I got to see what a quality really felt like it was exhilarating for my birthday and squid games was extra fun and they really took care of me in good ways and I think it was a positive experience for me and I think for society as a whole,1,

Mary nicole lorenzana,16,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,This time around the game (Amber Sky 2088) was much shorter and unfortunately some of the sensors were a bit off and the game had to be stopped to troubleshoot it. But that takes away from the experience. Due to the  shorter time frame and malfunctioning equipment it was like most sequals -not as good as the first one. Therefore only three stars overall.,1,
Kartiki Sharma,6,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,Huge thanks to Derek for happily hosting/helping us setup and being standup to troubleshoot/pause when needed. We look forward to coming back again!,1,
Benjamin Chevoor,26,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",5 months ago,3) Someone wearing the equipment before me had a reaaaally strong perfume. It's all I could smell during the experience. It soaked into my clothes and was all I could smell after until I changed and showered. Gross.,1,

Marco Yee (Icyy),13,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",6 months ago,"Not really sure if it was just my headset, I am a vr enthusiast. I personally owned the first HTC vive, the oculus rift, I've previously owned a quest 2 and my daily driver is a quest 3. I've never used a Pico before (the one that sandbox uses) but the frame rate is absolute garbage. I would say that the avg frame rate you're probably looking at is sub 50 fps. For people that don't play vr normally, this can be vomit inducing. There are times where the frame literally freezes for a second and you won't be able to orient yourself. The staff were nice though so that's +1 star. If you go with a group of 6, you're better off taking your money and buying 2 quest 2's for 300 each and getting whatever game piques you're interest. You actually get to keep the headsets and there's always more games out coming out. The hand and feet tracking is just a gimmick and doesn't affect gameplay.",3,

J S,490,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"I believe we paid like 65-70$ each and we played for 34 minutes total. We played the zombie game which is basically Left4Dead but a king of the hill mode where you can't leave a 15x15 area. You can't pick the same weapon as anyone else, which is weird. I ended up with the shotgun which basically had an effective range of 5 feet. There are 3 chapters in the game and each last about 10 minutes. We ended up ""winning"" the game and it ended very quickly. Again, the game is pretty basic and it's not very hard or scary. I thought the game would be at least an hour but 34 minutes? That is ridiculous for the price. The idea is cool, you get VR headset, arm and leg trackers, and you hold a mock weapon. But the game is just so easy and short. It's fun while you play but not something you'd ever want to play again, even the other ""games"" which seem like the same thing just different themes.",7,

I think we played for about 45 min. It costs $60 per person, no matter how many people are in your group, so over $400 after taxes for our group. For that cost I wish the videos and stats they send over had more to it, as it costs them little to nothing. At least show more footage of the team playing the game, it will encourage customers to share their videos with other people, and make it feel more worth.",1,
Natasha,19,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,terrible experience and overpriced. we played for around 45 mins which was not worth what we paid. for majority of the game my weapon wasn't working (I would pull the trigger but it didn't shoot) and I signaled for help 3 times w/o anyone coming to check in on us???? I couldn't enjoy the game w my friends cuz I kept dying as I had no defense.

Azad,30,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"This was a wonderful and unique experience! It was my first virtual reality experience, so I didn't go in expecting anything, yet I was amazed at how realistic and fun it was. Our host was Rafid and he was most amazing. I would have given it 5 stars if the head gear was more comfortable. I found it painful on my nose, especially when it's a little heavy. I also did not like how you can't change guns in the middle of the game. I had the pistol and it was a really boring gun, and although the experience can be paused, they did not switch out my gun when asked to. It is also quite expensive! It would be more logical to charge a set fee for the booking of the session, and a reduced fee per player. So instead of $60 per player, it should be $60 plus $40 per additional player. They provide lenses for people with glasses which is really cool, and they also make a highlight video of the experience and send it out to every participant, which is so so lovely as I love photographs. Although it is an exceptional feature, I wish the videos were longer. Overall a wonderful experience",5,

Mariano Maza,152,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,"My 8 year old and me went to ""Curse of Davy Jones"" and it was great. You need to make it at least 15 min to sign the waivers and get the equipment on your ankles, wrists, vest, backpack, VR goggles and headphones (you can't wear glasses). The host (Sam was awesome!) walks you through the process and helps answering any questions. Once you're all set, the game starts. It was a lot of fun. You get helped through the headphones if you get stuck. It probably lasted for about 30 min. Then you take off the equipment and go review the video. It's a well thought product and will certainly comeback to explore other games.",3,

The result however was all expectations were blown out of the water. The haptic vest, plus holding a physical gun all added to the incredibly immersive and entertaining experience. We loved it so much that we went in again the next week and had even more fun. The experience was great, all the employees are kind and welcoming, and the video that you get afterwards makes the entire visit extremely memorable. I've probably watched our groups video a dozen times over. Definitely worth a visit, the only thing I'd mention is that it is a bit costly, but the cost is well appropriated for all the different avenues of fun you'll have.",0,
