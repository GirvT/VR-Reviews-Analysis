Aayush Sharma,30,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",a month ago,,5,"Thank you for taking your time to share your experience. We genuinely appreciate your feedback. While we are sorry to hear that your visit did not meet your expectations, there are a few things that we would like to clarify:' '1) In addition to our big game space, our game selection is over 55 (100+ all devices considered, https://vrnoble.com/contents-best-vr-game-2022/) while all other arcades provide less than 50. We do not know where your comment ""The selection of games is tiny compared to other vr arcades"" came from?' '2) The package you insisted on selecting against our advice is indeed not suitable for a group of 3 kids and one of them 7-year-old, which you lied over the phone saying only 1 7-yr-old kid. We understand that not every customer has previous VR experience(which you stated you all had). We spent lots of time providing guidance throughout the entire game session. We even upgraded your package for free. Everybody in your group said they had a great time and were happy with our service and the upgrade too at the time.' ""3) Please understand that different packages offer different hardwares/games and services. Please select the package with the racing sets if that's what you prefer to use."" '4) Please do not tell me an affordable price is not what you, as a customer, do not want, and you want to be charged more. Thanks for you generous gesture of offering. However, we aim to keep our commitment of providing the best VR services in GTA to our customers, as well as at the best prices (most affordable).' '4) We feel that your 2 star rating and omitting important facts is very unfair to us and being very ungrateful. However, everybody is different, we wish you good luck."
John renzo Abiera,9,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"Overall, worst VR experience. It was definitely not worth $100 for the hour.",3,"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. We genuinely appreciate your feedback and are sorry to hear that your visit did not meet your expectations.' ""Regarding the calibration issue, it seems there was a persistent misunderstanding from a non-technical customer. The calibration process aligns the VR experience within a typical +/- 10-degree range based on the initial head orientation accuracy. This slight variation is usually imperceptible during gameplay, or when perceptible when distance is large, it won't causing players to bump into each other."" 'Our staff is committed to ensuring the best experience. During your session, you expressed satisfaction and appreciation, and no additional issues were reported at that time. We always encourage our guests to communicate any ongoing problems immediately so we can address them promptly.' 'We strive to provide a seamless and enjoyable VR experience and will use your feedback to improve our services. We hope you might consider giving us another chance in the future to demonstrate the quality experience we aim to deliver. Thank you again for your constructive comments."
Cait H,6,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,,4,"Thank you for your feedback. We are sorry to hear about your experience and appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.' 'Game Selection: It appears there was a misunderstanding regarding the game selection. While our website does showcase a wide variety of games, not all of them are available as free-roaming experiences. For the Free-roaming games package you selected are limited to six specific titles, from which we selected the best four for your session. We aim to provide the most engaging and enjoyable experiences, and we apologize if this was not clearly communicated.' ""Calibration and Setup: The calibration process aligns with the game developer's design, utilizing four cameras to sense orientation. Typically, the calibration is accurate within a +/- 10-degree range. This slight deviation is generally only perceptible when players are beyond a good distance. When you are at distance, you won't possibly have any physical contact. While we acknowledge your concern, the calibration was within standard operational limits. Our staff was nearby throughout your session, and we encourage guests to reach out directly during gameplay. Furthermore, you expressed satisfaction post-session, which suggests a more immediate communication could have helped address these concerns effectively."" 'We value your feedback and are committed to improving our services. Should you give us another chance, we would be more than happy to ensure a more tailored and seamless VR experience for you and your partner. Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
Ashley Girgis,11,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,A unique experience but wish there were more multiplayer options and easier set up or adapting to the game. Try super hot and face your fears and look around for things to grab,0,"Thank you for your feedback! We're pleased you enjoy our platform, especially your preference of the multiplayer options that have already made up over half of our games. While game design and ease of use are primarily handled by the developers and software companies we partner with, we hope to select games with greater gaming experience in the future. Thank you for choosing us, and we look forward to your continued enjoyment!"

Leticia Ly,3,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",3 months ago,,3,"Thank you for your feedback on your experience. I appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns:' 'Sanitation: All headsets are thoroughly sanitized before being provided to any customer. We utilized unused backup headsets for your session to expedite the process. These were prepared in advance and cleaned while you were engaged with the games, which is why you didnâ€™t see us performing the sanitation.' 'Gameplay Guidance: Our role is to provide the venue, equipments, and software needed for a great gaming experience; However, solving the escape room puzzles/games is up to the players. Calibration was not an issue because the game progressed without using the new calibration. Our approach ensures that everyone can enjoy the challenge and satisfaction of figuring out the puzzles independently.' 'Overall Experience: It appears that out of the eight games you played, there was only one game that did not meet your expectations, based on your review, and we gave you extra 30 minutes. We strive to ensure every player has a positive experience, and we regret that this was not fully achieved in your case.' 'We always aim to provide the best possible service and gaming experience, and we value all feedback as it helps us improve. Thank you for visiting us and sharing your thoughts."

Trevor Guy,2,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 months ago,,,
Colin Phan,39,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",6 months ago,,4,"The VR headset has a proximate sensor inside that needs to touch your skin on your forehead. If you constantly took the headset off and/or blocked the sensor by hair/sweet, the headset would think it went idle and slept into black. Even if we helped you to wake it up several times, eventually the player needs to learn how to use the device by himself. You did well most of the time. Hope we all can do better next time. "

Pamela Rodrigues,3,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",7 months ago,"Wowzers. I guess the one star is for it being open. Other than that what a very strange experience that was with who I hope is the owner because an employee could never dare treat a customer like that. From the very obvious annoyance of my even being there to the ""we don't take responsibility of anyone's safety"" I don't know where to start.  I asked very simple questions being that I have never done vr about a party of young boys costing me 600 dollars.  About the process of the gaming,  the safety and God forbid I asked how many staff would be here.  I partly asked these questions because the reviews spoke about the lack of staff knowledge.  Lol. He pretty much told me I didn't have the right to ask such questions. I am in the parking lot in awe of what just transpired.  How do people run business like this. A huge no to this place. Unfortunately cuz these places only survive by word of mouth.  And especially among moms like me with 4 kids looking for a bday party every few months with lots of friends doing the same.  Good luck",4,

We recently hired a new staff who needs more and better training. The good news is we will soon launch our FREE ROAM games at very reasonable prices. Please subscribe to our newsletters to be the first to know when it comes out. You are welcome to come to use your free hour. I ensure you will be extremely happy this time."
Lush Parris,23,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,This was my second time doing VR and I was a bit disappointed.

Aleksandra,3,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,"We visited the VR Noble today. We are an older couple so this was a great experience for us. We mainly used Google Earth App. Well worth it and the price is great comparing to downtown locations. We were there a few minutes before our appoitment. As instructed, we called the number to have someone come down to let us in. There was a moment of consternation - no listing on the directory, voice mail box was full, no one was picking up the phone. Rest assured, someone did come down, showed us in, explained how VR works. If you are new to VR it takes some time to figure it out how everything works. You should book two hours then. I will come back again. Place is very clean but be prepared for heat - the equipment is generating it. There is a very clean bathroom in the hallway.",0,
