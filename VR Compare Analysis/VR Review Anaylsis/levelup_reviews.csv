Mouse The Mouse,2,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,"Absolutely the best VR game place in Toronto! Very clean environment with EXCELLENT staff. Highly recommend this place if you're new to the VR world -  if you ever get stuck or don't know how to operate something, the game master (staff) is watching the same screen you're viewing and they walk you through exactly what to do using their voice through the headphones you're wearing. My friend and I did 1 hour - and that was a perfect length! Maybe 1.5 hr max. Any more than that you'd start feeling a little dizzy and the head piece starts digging into your forehead a bit and hurts. Like others said in the review, the loading time between games is a bit long and can be slightly frustrating but overall the experience is fantastic! SUPER FUN and a perfect activity for dates, hangouts, birthday event, etc! We did an hour and was able to play 4 games! Not for very long in each one but at least a few rounds - we just wanted to try different games! You can choose the games based on difficulty levels which are clearly displayed, so it's easy to choose, and the game master can give you recommendations if you don't know where to start!",2,"Hey Mouse the Mouse,' ""Thank you so much for the awesome words! We are happy to hear that you had a great experience. We strive to provide the best customer service possible so that you will enjoy your time here at our arcade. It's because of reviews like yours, we are inspired to strive more for the satisfaction of our clients! Our staff are highly trained to assist and make sure our customers needs are met. We're also glad to hear you were able to play 4 games! That's amazing! We also have events for groups whenever there's an occasion to celebrate! Come back soon and our staff can recommend more games to choose from. Thanks again for your review and we hope to see you again soon!"" 'Levelup Reality"

In order for this to happen, we made an exception to hold down a credit card even though all bookings are paid in full according to policy. You were notified that the card would be charged on the day of your booking and you agreed to pay the full amount in person.' 'On the day of your booking, only 4 out of 8 people showed, therefore the card was then charged for the remaining 4 no-shows. This was in accordance to the policy you agreed to. If the card could not be charged, then a different card should have been provided to us.' 'You then disagreed with the charge and repeatedly asked for a refund even though we do not offer refunds for cancellations within 24 hours as per our publicly posted policy.' 'You stated here you wanted more VR time and, in good faith, we generously provided a 100% account credit for the 4 no-shows which we did not have to do. Although this solution is given at the expense of our business, we provided this because we care about our customers.' 'When our timeslots are booked full, we allocate enough staff to help ensure our customers have a great time. When last minute cancellations occur, we lose the ability to book in another customer while incurring extra staff costs, which ends up hurting our business.' ""All our policies are fair and transparent. We cannot operate a highly rated business through deception. It's unfortunate that you will not accept our solution which makes it clear that even going beyond our own policies will not make it right."

I've never played virtual reality so there was a bit of a learning curve to learning the controls but once you get the hand of it its really fun. Only thing that could have been better is the introduction and orientation process - it was quite rushed. It was a busy day with lots of players and the 2 staff seemed overwhelmed with getting everyone set up and oriented. We were told that a staff member would come around and explain the controls however no one did and an orientation ideo started playing which we could barely hear because it was so noisy. So we had no idea how to get started when we were sent to our rooms which cut into our playing time a bit when everything had to be explained to us again by a staff member.

Table [Just-A-Table],5,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,Personaly I have never been there but I meet one of the staff members after hours on the game rec room. It was the best time I have ever had with human interactions but sadly I never was able to talk to him ever agean because he has said to me he is quitting to go back home. But I do recommend if you want a good time,0,

Katie Jones,8,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,"My second time at Levelup Reality and it was a total blast! I went with three friends (it was their first time) and we played a game with a bunch of mini games within it and competed against each other. It's insane how real it feels inside VR and the graphics are incredible. Staff was super helpful and kind, thanks so much!",1,
Mike Devyatov,9,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,"Went with my girlfriend recently to try out VR and the experience at Levelup was amazing from the equipment to the staff. The kind lady working there was attentive and enthusiastic the entire time we were there, helping us out, giving tips and teaching us when needed while using VR. The equipment and locations were great as well with all the VR gear and the space working as expected and beyond. I would recommend this location and experience to anyone.",1,
Marie-Claire Asseko,131,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,It was my first VR immersion and it was super fun. The manager (a really nice guy from Ireland whose name I forgot to ask) was very helpful and supervised our experience all along. I came it dripping sweat. Definitely worth the 30$ for 30 mins rate!,1,

The staff here are super friendly and helpful and they will even give you tips if you're getting stuck on something.

Adeel Rizvi,18,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,Loved the experience. I had some previous experience in virtual reality but it was nothing compared to the HTC vive that level up is stocked with. They have a huge library of games for every type of person. The service is really good. They help you through the more difficult games and help set up each game as fast as possible to make the most of your time. It's a small place but when your in the virtual world it doesn't even matter.,2,

Allison Sosnoski,1,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,"My boyfriend and I went yesterday, each for a 1 hour session. I'm not much of a gamer so I was worried an hour would be too much, but we both had a total blast! The game selection was great (at least for us beginners), and we didn't want to leave. It is a bit dizzying at times, so I don't know how it would feel for someone with more motion sickness than me, but it's overall a super accessible and fun setup. I wish we'd remembered the names of the man and woman that assisted us, they were both amazing! They were extremely knowledgeable about the system, and offered tips and advice without being intrusive. I do  remember that we spoke with William on the phone before coming, and he was also very helpful and considerate with helping us figure out how to use our gift vouchers. We're definitely coming back. Thanks!!",2,
Johnathan Rutherford,9,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",6 years ago,"We had an amazing time! The service was great and staff was very informative. The session started with a short about 5 minute tutorial. From that point we were able to decide the types of games we wanted to play. We chose to do multiplayer and play together. The staff helped explained each game in a quick and efficient manner right before each one which was helpful, but then let us do our thing after that unless we needed them. The price point felt very good for the experience!",2,
